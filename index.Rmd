### 3 big ideas `r emo::ji("bulb")`
1. tsibble
2. mable
3. fable
]

???

I want to talk about one streamlined workflow for ts under the tidyverse framework,
using 2 packages. I'll introduce you three big ideas behind these 2 pkgs: they are
tsibble, mable and fable and how they link together. I hope to explain them 
concretely with data stories.

---

## Tidy data workflow

.center[
![](img/r4ds.svg)
]

The underlying data structure: [tibble]()

???

I believe this diagram isn't foreign to you. This is the tidyverse model.
Each module here is powered by one of the tidyverse packages. The tidyverse 
plays seamlessly with each other. And one of the fundamental reasons is 
they all share the same underlying data structure, which is data frame or tibble. 
So the data is actually placed in the center of the diagram.

But why we cannot bring this workflow easily into time series?

---

## Current time series workflow

.center[
![](img/r4ts.svg)
]
<hr>
.center[
![](img/adhoc.svg)
]

???

Because the current time series objects in R are model-focused. By saying model,
I mean it not only includes statistical models, but also forecasting,
decomposition, autocorrelation function, and other time series tools. All the 
methods expect matrices as inputs. But 
the data arrives in the right beginning of this process, it rarely comes in the
matrix form. We have to write so much ad hoc code get the data into a model-ready 
time series object. It is a pain, bc of the mismatch

We hope to change that.

---

## Tidy time series workflow `r emo::ji("smiley")`

.center[
![](img/r4tidyverts.svg)
]

The underlying data structure: [tsibble]()

???

Some new tools are provided to streamline this workflow and make time series
analysis a bit easier and more fun, more intuitively. The tsibble pkg will focus on
the tidy and transform part, the fable package will do time series modelling and
forecasting. The visualisation is done with ggplot2 and its ext.

To make this workflow work, they're going to share the same underlying data
str, which is a new data abstraction for time series.

## A modern reimagining of time series

???

We call it "tsibble", which is a time series tibble. If you know, ts is 
the native object to represent time series in R, so this is where the name 
tsibble comes from.

---

# An example: electricity consumption

```{r load}
```

.center[
.card[.large[many series]]
.card[.large[many measurements]]
.card[.large[fine time resolutions]]
]

.footnote[[Data source: Department of the Environment and Energy, Australia](https://data.gov.au/dataset/4e21dea3-9b87-4610-94c7-15a8a77907ef)]

???

Now we're going to have some fun with an open dataset. This dataset is about residential
electricity consumption in Australia. It's a tibble with 46M obs and 8 variables.
The column `customer_id` includes unique identifiers for each household;
thousands of households in this data. And `reading_datetime` gives the 
timestamps when the reading is recorded every 30 mins. `general_supply` is the 
variable that we're interested in forecasting. There are some other 
measurements in the table as well. How are we going to turn this data into a
tsibble.

---

## Time series has its own semantics

```{r coerce, echo = TRUE}
```

1. <i class='far fa-clock'></i> **index**: a variable that represents **time**
2. <i class="fas fa-users"></i> **key**: identifying variables that define **series**
.center[
*.red[1.] + .red[2.] determine distinct rows in a tsibble.*
]

???

What makes time series special or different from a tibble? Bc it has its own semantics.

The first is obviously the index variable that represents time. In this case,
it's `reading_datetime`. Tsibble supports a wide range of time classes, from numerics
to date-times, to nanotime. The second component is what we call "key". They are
identifying variables that define series or entities over time. For this example,
each household is a series and the key variable is `customer_id`. You can also include 
multiple variables in the key.

Index defines the time and key defines the series.

The key together with the index uniquely identifies each observation in a tibble.
Basically it means each customer has to have unique timestamps.

---

## Contextual pretty printing

```{r print, highlight.output = 1:2}
```

.center[
.card[.large[time interval]]
.card[.large[time zone of date-times]]
.card[.large[the number of series]]
]

???

Now we have a tsibble.

Tibble gives a very nice printing method and tsibble is going to enhance that by adding
contextual information. Now we have a tsibble with its data dimensions. It
recognises 30 min interval and the time zone associated with the index. Here we
have UTC, but you might have time zones with DST. Tsibble will respect any time
zone in the data.

The key variable is reported with the number of series. We have 2,924 customers
in this big table.

---

## Look at data early: time gaps

```{r line-na, fig.height = 2.3}
```

```r
elec_ts %>% fill_gaps()
```

```{r fill-gaps, fig.height = 2.3}
```

???

We have some time gaps in this data. They are implicit missing values. Since
ggplot2 isn't aware of these gaps, it always draws a straight line between data
segments if use `geom_line()`. Tsibble comes with a handy function `fill_gaps()`. 
It fills in these gaps with `NA` by default or you can do by values or functions.
So these lines can be removed from the plot easily with `fill_gaps()`.

---

## Implicit missing value handlers

.pull-left[
.div-middle[
1. Check: `has_gaps()`
2. Reveal: `scan_gaps()`
3. Summarise: `count_gaps()`
4. Fill in time gaps: `fill_gaps()`
]
]
.pull-right[
.large[
```r
has_gaps(elec_ts)
```
```{r has-gaps, highlight.output = 12:13}
```
]
]

???

Except for `fill_gaps()`, tsibble provides other three verbs to handle implicit
missing values. They are all suffixed by `_gaps()`. Nearly 20% of customers have
time gaps. The output shown here, you can see the last two customers with gaps.
Almost all model functions require a complete series. So it's a good
practice to look at and fill in those time gaps at the first place.

---

## A new adverb `index_by()`: time-aware grouping

```{r index-by, echo = TRUE, highlight.output = 1}
```

???

Tsibble works nicely with dplyr and tidyr verbs. A new adverb you will use 
quite often is `index_by()`. It's similar to `group_by()` by preparing grouping str,
but it only groups the index. Combined with `summarise()`, the data can be
aggregated to any higher-level time resolutions.

For example, I want to work with hourly data instead of 30 mins. Then I use
`floor_date()`/`celling_date()`/`round_date()` from the lubridate pkg on the 
index variable inside the `index_by()`, followed by `summarise()`. I'll get hourly 
average electricity usage across all the households. The result is going to be a 
single time series at one hour interval. The key is implicit.

---

## Functional programming: map and roll

]

???

Another chunk of operations for time series is definitely rolling window. It
not only does iteration over each element like what `purrr::map()` does, but 
also needs to roll. What I'm going to do is to wake up this cat, and let her roll.

Type stability suffix: `*_dbl()`, `*_int()`, `*_lgl()`, `*_chr()`, `*_dfr()`, `*_dfc()`

Parallel processing prefix: `future_*`.
]

???

Actually there are 3 different types of rolling operations: sliding, tiling,
and stretching. It's just like purrr, `slide()` takes a single input, `slide2()` takes
two inputs and `pslide()` for multiples. If you have a data frame to roll by obs, you
need to use `pslide()`. For the purpose of type stability,
they are going to return a list, and other variants include integers, characters
and etc. And in the recent version, I've added the
parallel support, they are all prefixed with `future_` by using the furrr package
by Davis as a backend. If doing some rolling regression, it's nice to save some time by 
rolling in parallel.

You can put an arbitrary function to these rolling window.

---

## Rolling averages
.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
slide_dbl(x, ~ mean(.), 
  .size = 24)
```
.div-middle[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
tile_dbl(x, ~ mean(.), 
  .size = 24)
```
]
.div-middle[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
stretch_dbl(x, ~ mean(.), 
  .init = 24)
```
]
]
.pull-right[
<img src="img/slide-mean.gif", height="160px">
<img src="img/tile-mean.gif", height="160px">
<img src="img/stretch-mean.gif", height="160px">
]

???

A simple example is rolling average. It uses purrr-like syntax. You can call
a function name or an anonymous function using `~`. I specify the window size to be 
24 (1 day) and it's rolling forward from left to right. If you want to move in an 
opposite direction, just change the window size to be negative. These 3 rolling
window as you can result in different averages.

---

## Rolling forecast

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plan(multiprocess)
expand_forecast <- function(...) {
  # 3 lines of tsibble + fable code ...
}
elec_avg %>% 
  future_pstretch(expand_forecast, .size = 24, .init = 168)
```
.center[
<img src="img/rolling.gif">
]

???

A more advanced example, but extremely useful is rolling forecast. I defined
a custom function called `expand_forecast()` and also enable parallel processing
by using `future_pstretch()`. It's never been that easy to do a expanding forecast.
A nice thing about functional programming, we can focus on writing expressions,
instead of wring a long for-loop statement. So what sort of code goes into the 
`expand_forecast()`. This Q brings us to the next part of the presentation: 
tidy forecasting.

How many of you have used the forecast package before?

The fable is the tidy replacement of the forecast package.

Why we call it fable?

.left-column[
## The first 30 days on the calendar
]
.right-column[
```{r split-data}
```

```{r calendar-train}
```
]

???

Let's look at the data in the first 30 days of January. Each facet gives
a daily snapshot of hourly electricity demand. The peak in the late afternoon is
driven by the use of air conditioning. January is summer time in Australia. You
can see some days have much higher usage coloured by red, bc they are very hot 
days with max temp greater than 32 degrees.

I'm going to use this subset to forecast the demand one day ahead. And I hold 
the data of Jan 31 as the test set.

---

## .blue[mable]: `model()` the data

```{r model, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
```

.small[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
elec_mbl <- elec_jan %>% 
  model(
    yesterday = NAIVE(avg_kwh ~ lag("1 day")), #<<
    ets = ETS(avg_kwh) #<<
  )
```
]

.pull-left[
```
*#> # A mable: 1 x 2
#>   yesterday ets         
#>   <model>   <model>     
#> 1 <SNAIVE>  <ETS(M,N,M)>
```
]
.pull-right[
.alert[
1. **succinct model representation**
2. **`summarise()` semantics: reduces rows**
]
]

???

Let's model the data.

I construct two models for the tsibble data with the `model()` verb. The first
model I built is a naive model as a benchmark. The naive method simply uses the
observed values from yesterday as forecasts. The second model is ETS, exponential
smoothing, which can be thought of as a weighted average of the past values.
ETS is also short for error, trend and seasonality. 

The model function uses the formula interface. On the LHS, we specify the average 
supply as the response variable, and on the RHS we can put some specials related
to the method. I've specified the naive function to use the 24 values from yesterday instead
of the value from the previous hour. If we don't specify the RHS like ets, it will do 
automatic model selection by picking up the best model for you.

Now we have a mable back. A mable is a model table that contains model objects.
Each cell shows a succinct model representation by saying I have a seasonal naive
model and an ets with three selected components.

Models are a reduced form of the data.
So the `model()` function is an analogue of `summarise()`, using the same semantics, 
because it also reduces the data down to a single summary but it happens to be 
a model object of that summary.

---

## Inspect mable

1. `tidy()` model parameters
2. `glance()` a one-row per model summary
3. `augment()` with model fits (`.fitted` & `.resid`)

```{r tidy}
```

???

In order to look at parameter estimates, information criterion or residuals from
model objects. We just use the familiar broom functions: `tidy()`, `glance()` and `augment()`.
By applying the `tidy()` function on the mable, we get the parameter estimates
for the models we've built. We have got a bunch of parameters for ets like 
alpha & beta and initial level estimates.

---

## .blue[fable]: `forecast()` the future

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
elec_fbl <- elec_mbl %>% 
  forecast(h = "1 day")
```
]
.pull-right[
.alert[
1. **human-friendly specification**
2. **point forecasts + distribution**
]
]

```{r forecast, highlight.output = 1:2}
```

???

It's time to forecast. We pipe the mable into the `forecast()`, and we're doing
a one-day-ahead forecast equivalent to 24-step-ahead. It supports human-friendly input and 
so we can read more naturally forecasting with 1 day horizon. It's convenient,
bc we no longer need to mentally compute how many hours/minutes/seconds in a day. 
But you can still do `h = 24`.

We're done with the forecast, we have a forecasting table, which is a fable. It's
a special tsibble, which includes the future predications. It not only tells you
the point forecasts, but also an underlying pred distribution that involves uncertainty.
Bc we are forecasters, not fortune tellers.

You can see the normal distribution with the mean and the standard deviation in
the last column `.distribution`.

This is one of my favourite features about fable: reporting distribution forecasts.
So you're able to produce any level of predication interval you like.

---

.left-column[
## Visualise fable .large[`geom_forecast()`]
### - Yesterday
]
.right-column[
```{r vis-naive}
```
]

???

We'll see the forecasts more clearly with plots using `geom_forecast()`.

The naive method repeats the yesterday's pattern, but the 80 and 95 PIs are quite 
wide, and even goes below zero.

How about ets?

---

.left-column[
## Visualise fable .large[`geom_forecast()`]
### - Yesterday
### - ETS
]
.right-column[
```{r vis-ets}
```
]

???

The ets nicely captures the daily trend and produces a much narrower PI.

---

## Assess model performance

```{r accuracy, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
```

```{r pred-data, fig.height = 3}
```

???

Which model performs better?

Use `accaracy()` to compare the predications with the test set that I held before.

Looking at accuracy measures, ets does slightly better than naive in terms of RMSE. 
But they all tend to give underestimated predications. The blank line in the plot is
the actual data. Looks like it's another hot day in January. If we have weather
information like temperatures, we can include them to improve the forecasts, but
need to use a different model that allows for ex regressors, e.g. ARIMA.

So far, I have showed all the steps from model building to model assessments for just one
time series. Would be any different if we have multiple time series in a table?

---

## Models are fundamentally scalable

```{r subset}
```

```{r batch, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

???

No. Bc models are fundamentally scalable.

Tsibble as a modern reimaging of time series, it designs for hosting many time
series together. Especially the series have already been defined when we created the
tsibble. We are obviously interested in forecasting the demand for each household
here.

I've removed some troublesome series, ended up with 1480 households. 
No extra steps needed for forecasting at scale. 
Just as what we did before, we can directly pipe them into `model()`, and it will fit an 
ets model for each customer at once. and then happy `forecast()`.
I also take a log transformation on the response variable to ensure that I get
positive forecasts back. The `forecast()` will take care of the back-transformation
for you.

---

## Key is the `r emo::ji("key")` to unlock series across tsibble, mable and fable

.pull-left[
.large[
```{r batch-model}
```
]
]
.pull-right[
```{r batch-forecast}
```
```{r batch-plot, fig.height = 13}
```
]

???

You can see 1480 models have been fitted in the mable. The key variable is
always the key to refer to a series across tsibble, mable and fable. 

We do not store historical data in model objects and fable.

Models are scalable but visualisation is not. So I just plot 4 customers with
their forecasts here. At the individual levels, lots of noise, producing much 
larger PI as well.

---

## Much more in the tidyverts

* Decomposition `STL()`
* Simulation `simulate()`
* Interpolation `interpolate()`
* Refitting and streaming `refit()` & `stream()`

???

I've showed a proportion of what tsibble and fable can do. We've got decomposition,
simulation based on model fits, interpolation of missing values and model 
supports for streaming data. So check them out.
