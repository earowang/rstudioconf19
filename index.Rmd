]

???

I want to talk about one streamlined workflow for ts under the tidyverse framework,
using 2 packages. I'll explain three big ideas behind these 2 pkgs: they are
tsibble, mable and fable and how they link together. I hope to explain them 
concretely with data examples.

## Tidy data workflow

.center[
![](img/r4ds.svg)
]

The underlying data structure: [tibble]()

???

I believe this diagram isn't foreign to you. This is the tidyverse model.
Each module here is powered by one of the tidyverse packages. The tidyverse 
plays nicely with each other. And one of the fundamental reasons is 
they all share the same underlying data structure, which is data frame or tibble. 
So the diagram actually places the data in the center.

But why we cannot bring this workflow easily into time series?

---

## Current time series workflow

.center[
![](img/r4ts.svg)
]
<hr>
.center[
![](img/adhoc.svg)
]

???

Because the current time series objects in R are model-focused. By saying model,
I mean it not only includes statistical models, but also forecasting,
decomposition, autocorrelation function, and etc. They require matrices. But 
the data arrives in the right beginning of this process, it rarely comes in the
matrix form. We have to write so much ad hoc code get the data into a model-ready 
time series object. It is a pain, bc of the mismatch

---

## Tidy time series workflow `r emo::ji("smiley")`

.center[
![](img/r4tidyverts.svg)
]

The underlying data structure: [tsibble]()

???

Some new tools are provided to streamline this workflow and make time series
analysis a bit easier. The tsibble pkg will focus on
the tidy and transform part, the fable package will do time series modelling and
forecasting. The visualisation is done with ggplot2 and its ext.

I hope to make time series analysis more fun and intuitively.

To make this workflow work, they're going to share the same underlying data
str, which is a new data abstraction for time series.

## A modern reimagining of time series

???

We call it "tsibble", which is a time series tibble. If you know, ts is 
the native object to represent time series in R, so this is where the name 
tsibble comes from.

---

# An example: electricity consumption

```{r load}
```

.center[
.card[.large[many series]]
.card[.large[many measurements]]
.card[.large[fine time resolutions]]
]

.footnote[[Data source: Department of the Environment and Energy, Australia](https://data.gov.au/dataset/4e21dea3-9b87-4610-94c7-15a8a77907ef)]

???

Now we're going to have some fun with an open dataset. This dataset is about residential
electricity consumption in Australia. It's a tibble with 46M obs and 8 variables.
The column `customer_id` includes unique identifiers for each household;
thousands of households in this data. And `reading_datetime` gives the 
timestamps when the reading is recorded basically every 30 mins. `general_supply` is the 
variable that we're interested in forecasting. There are some other 
measurements in the table as well. How are we going to turn this data into a
tsibble.

---

## Time series has its own semantics

```{r coerce, echo = TRUE}
```

1. <i class='far fa-clock'></i> **index**: a variable that represents **time**
2. <i class="fas fa-users"></i> **key**: identifying variables that define **series**
.center[
*.red[1.] + .red[2.] determine distinct rows in a tsibble.*
]

???

What makes time series different from a tibble? Bc it has its own semantics.

The first is obviously the index variable that represents time. In this case,
it's `reading_datetime`. It supports a wide range of time classes, from numerics
to nanotime, to even ordered factors. The second component is what we call "key". They are
identifying variables that define series or entities over time. For this example,
each household is a series and the key variable is `customer_id`.

Index defines the time and key defines the series.

The key together with the index uniquely identifies each observation in a tibble.
Basically it means each customer has to have unique timestamps.

---

## Contextual pretty printing

```{r print, highlight.output = 1:2}
```

.center[
.card[.large[time interval]]
.card[.large[time zone of date-times]]
.card[.large[the number of series]]
]

???

Tibble gives a very nice printing and tsibble is going to enhance that by adding
contextual information. Now we have a tsibble with its data dimensions. It
recognises 30 min interval and the time zone associated with the index. Here we
have UTC, so makes the life a bit easier.

The key variable is reported with the number of series. We have 2,924 customers
in this big table.

---

## Look at data early: time gaps

```{r line-na, fig.height = 2.3}
```

```r
elec_ts %>% fill_gaps()
```

```{r fill-gaps, fig.height = 2.3}
```

???

We have some time gaps in this data. They are implicit missing values. Since
ggplot2 isn't aware of these gaps, it always draws a straight line between data
segments. Tsibble comes with a handy function `fill_gaps()`. It's a simple call
to fill in these gaps with `NA` by default or you can do by values or functions.
So we can remove these lines from the plot.

---

## Implicit missing value handlers

.pull-left[
.div-middle[
1. Check: `has_gaps()`
2. Reveal: `scan_gaps()`
3. Summarise: `count_gaps()`
4. Fill in time gaps: `fill_gaps()`
]
]
.pull-right[
.large[
```r
has_gaps(elec_ts)
```
```{r has-gaps}
```
]
]

???

Except for `fill_gaps()`, tsibble provides other three verbs to handle implicit
missing values. They are all suffixed by `_gaps()`. Nearly 20% of customers have
time gaps. Almost all model functions require a complete series. So it's nice
to fill in those time gaps at the first place.

---

## A new adverb `index_by()`: time-aware grouping

```{r index-by, echo = TRUE, highlight.output = 1}
```

???

Tsibble works nicely with dplyr and tidyr verbs. A new adverb you will use 
quite often is `index_by()`. It's similar to `group_by()` by preparing grouping str,
but it only groups the index. Combined with `summarise()`, the data can be
aggregated to any higher-level time resolutions.

For example, I want to work with hourly data instead of 30 mins. Then I use
`floor_date()`/`celling_date()`/`round_date()` from the lubridate pkg on the 
index inside the `index_by()`, followed by `summarise()`. I'll get hourly 
average electricity usage across all the households. The result is going to a 
single time series at one hour interval.

---

## Functional programming: map and roll

]

???

Another chunk of operations for time series is definitely rolling window. It
not only does iteration over each element like what `purrr::map()` does, but 
also needs to roll. What I'm going to do is to wake up this cat, and let her roll.

Type stability suffix: `*_dbl()`, `*_int()`, `*_lgl()`, `*_chr()`, `*_dfr()`, `*_dfc()`

Parallel processing prefix: `future_*`.
]

???

Actually there are 3 different types of rolling operations: sliding, tiling,
and stretching. It's just like purrr, `slide()` takes a single input, `slide2()` takes
two inputs and `pslide()` for multiples. For the purpose of type stability,
they are going to return a list, and other variants include integers, characters
and etc. And in the recent version, I've added the
parallel support, they are all prefixed with `future_` by using the furrr package
by Davis as a backend. If doing some rolling regression, it's nice to save some time by 
rolling in parallel.

You can put an arbitrary function to these rolling window.

---

## Rolling averages
.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
slide_dbl(x, ~ mean(.), 
  .size = 24)
```
.div-middle[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
tile_dbl(x, ~ mean(.), 
  .size = 24)
```
]
.div-middle[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
stretch_dbl(x, ~ mean(.), 
  .init = 24)
```
]
]
.pull-right[
<img src="img/slide-mean.gif", height="160px">
<img src="img/tile-mean.gif", height="160px">
<img src="img/stretch-mean.gif", height="160px">
]

???

A simple example is rolling average. Again, it uses purrr-like syntax, by calling
a function or a formula. I specify the window size to be 24 and it's rolling
forward from left to right. If you want to move in an opposite direction, just
change the window size to be negative.

---

## Rolling forecast

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
plan(multiprocess)
expand_forecast <- function(...) {
  # 3 lines of tsibble + fable code ...
}
elec_avg %>% 
  future_pstretch(expand_forecast, .size = 24, .init = 168)
```
.center[
<img src="img/rolling.gif">
]

???

A more advanced example, but extremely useful is rolling forecast. I defined
a custom function called `expand_forecast()` and also enabled parallel processing
by using `future_pstretch()`. It's never been that easy to do a expanding forecast.
A nice thing about functional programming, we can focus on expressions or actions,
rather than wring a long for-loop statement. So what sort of code goes into the 
`expand_forecast()`. This Q brings us to the next part of the presentation: 
tidy forecasting.

How many of you have used the forecast package before?

The fable is the tidy replacement of the forecast.

.left-column[
## The first 30 days

.right-column[
```{r split-data}
```

```{r calendar-train}
```
]

???

Let's look at the data in the first 30 days of January. Each facet gives
a daily pattern of electricity demand. The peak in the late afternoon is primarily
driven by the use of air conditioning. January is summer time in Australia. You
can see some days have much higher usage, most likely they are very hot days.
I'm going to use this subset to forecast the demand one day ahead. And I hold 
the data of Jan 31 as the test set.

## .blue[mable]: `model()` the data

```

.small[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
elec_mbl <- elec_jan %>% 
  model(
    yesterday = NAIVE(avg_kwh ~ lag("1 day")), 
    ets = ETS(avg_kwh)
  )
```
]

.pull-left[
```
*#> # A mable: 1 x 2
#>   yesterday ets         
#>   <model>   <model>     
#> 1 <SNAIVE>  <ETS(M,N,M)>
```
]
.pull-right[
.alert[
1. **succinct model representation**
2. **`summarise()` semantics: reduces rows**
]
]

???

Let's model the data.

I construct two models for the tsibble data with the `model()` verb. The first
model I built is a naive model as a benchmark. The naive method simply uses the
observed values from yesterday as forecasts. The second model is ETS, exponential
smoothing, which can be thought of as a weighted average of the past values.
ETS is also short for error, trend and seasonality. The
model function uses the formula interface. On the LHS, we specify the average 
supply as the response variable, and on the RHS we can put some specials related
to the method. I've specified the naive function to use the 24 values from yesterday instead
of the value from the previous hour. If we don't specify the RHS like ets, it will do 
automatic model selection by picking up the best model for you.

Now we have a mable back. A mable is a model table that contains model objects.
It gives a succinct model representation by saying I have a seasonal naive
model and an ets with certain components.

The `model()` is an analogue of the `summarise()` semantics, because it also reduces the data
down to a single summary but it happens to a model object of that summary.

Models are reduced representations of the data down to simplistic structures 
that are described by coefficients.

---

## Inspect mable

1. `tidy()` model parameters
2. `glance()` a one-row per model summary
3. `augment()` with model fits (`.fitted` & `.resid`)

```{r tidy}
```

???

It's easy to extract parameter estimates, information criterion or residuals from
a mable. We just use the familiar broom functions: `tidy()`, `glance()` and `augment()`.
By applying the `tidy()` function on the mable, we get the parameter estimates
for the models we have.

---

## .blue[fable]: `forecast()` the future

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
elec_fbl <- elec_mbl %>% 
  forecast(h = "1 day")
```
]
.pull-right[
.alert[
1. **human-friendly specification**
2. **point forecasts + distribution**
]
]

```{r forecast, highlight.output = 1:2}
```

???

It's time to forecast. We pipe the mable into the `forecast()`, and we're doing
a one-day-ahead forecast. It supports human-friendly input, by reading forecast
horizon is 1 day instead of 24. It's convenient,
bc we no longer need to compute how many hours/minutes/seconds in a day.

We're done with the forecast, we have a forecasting table, which is a fable. It's
a special tsibble, which includes the future predications. It not only tells you
the point forecasts, but also an underlying pred distribution that involves uncertainty.
Bc we are forecasters, not fortune tellers.
You can see the normal distribution with the mean and the standard deviation.

---

.left-column[
## Visualise fable .large[`geom_forecast()`]
### - Yesterday
]
.right-column[
```{r vis-naive}
```
]

???

We'll see the forecasts more clearly with plots using `geom_forecast()`.

The naive method repeats the yesterday's pattern, but the 80 and 95 PIs are quite 
wide, and even goes below zero.

---

.left-column[
## Visualise fable .large[`geom_forecast()`]
### - Yesterday
### - ETS
]
.right-column[
```{r vis-ets}
```
]

???

The ets nicely captures the daily trend and produces a much narrower PI.

---

## Assess model performance

```{r accuracy, echo = TRUE, error = TRUE}
```

```{r pred-data, fig.height = 3}
```

???

Which model performs better?

By looking at accuracy measures, ets does slightly better than naive. But they
all tend to give underestimated predications. The blank line in the plot is
the actual data. Looks like it's another hot day in January. If we have weather
information like temperatures, it will help to improve the forecasts.

I have showed all the steps from model building to model assessments for just one
time series. Would be any different if we have multiple time series?

---

## Models are fundamentally scalable

```{r subset}
```

```{r batch, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
```

???

My answer is No. Bc models are fundamentally scalable.

Tsibble as a modern reimaging of time series, it designs for hosting many time
series together. Especially the series have been defined when we created the
tsibble. We are obviously interested in forecasting the demand for each household
simultaneously.

No extra steps needed. Just as what we did before, we can directly pipe 
them into `model()`, and it will fit an ets model for each time series at once. 
and then happy `forecast()`. It produces the forecast for each individual customer.
I also do a log transformation to ensure I get positive forecasts back. The `forecast()`
will do a back-transformation automatically.

It is just as easy as 1, 2, 3 lines of code.

---

## Key is the `r emo::ji("key")` to link tsibble, mable and fable

.pull-left[
.large[
```{r batch-model}
```
]
]
.pull-right[
```{r batch-forecast}
```
```{r batch-plot, fig.height = 13}
```
]

???

Models are scalable but visualisation is not. So I just include 4 customers in the
plot.
